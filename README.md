Lore
The Azumi, sometimes referred as Azumi-no-Isora, are an ancient tribe of water gods from Japan who excelled in fishing and are well versed in the way of water. It is said they are the descendants of Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi and Susano-o, the three gods sired by Izanagi after he returned from Yomi, the land of the dead. The deity Azumi is said to be a guardian of the people after which it is named, and can control the element of water similarly to its sibling deity, Isora.
